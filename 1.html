hello web


New Year's Day! I started studying compuer languages on the first day of 2022. I'm looking forward to achieve basic skills of a full-stack developer. Nevertheless the ultimate purpose of this self-taught-study is to make my life enjoyable. I'm planning to study the contents as following manner: <u>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</u> for essential knowledge and  <u>flask, react, spring, node.js</u> for
advanced skills. Not sure if this will be successful :)) But I'll do my best =)
First, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating web pages</strong> and web applications.
